                <p class="time">26th May, 2011</p>
                <p class="incomp">Incompatible with Eaglercraft</p>
                <p class="marginless">(This update includes 1.6 to 1.6.6)</p>
                <p>
                    New features:<br>
                    + Added Nether support to multiplayer<br>
                    + The client will ask minecraft.net if the current login is valid. If the server says “no”, a warning message appears in the client. You can still play the game even if this happens.<br>

                    + Doors make sound for other players in multiplayer<br>
                    + The record player now supports more than 15 different songs (you can’t get the records yet, though)<br>
                    + Activated dispensers make sounds and trigger particles in multiplayer<br>
                    + Players stuck in walls will slide towards the nearest gap if there is one<br>

                    + The renderer is now capped at 100 fps while there are chunks to be generated. The excess time will be spent generating chunks instead of rendering frames<br>
                    + The “limit framerate” option now limits the game to 40 fps and will spend at least 10 ms per frame sleeping<br>
                    + The “limit framerate” option has been reset to “off” for all players, enable it again if you want it<br>
                    <br>

                    * Seeds are now found in tall grass, using a hoe on the ground no longer works<br>
                    * Compressed network traffic more agressively<br>
                    * Blocks that don’t change appearance when the data changes don’t send block updates when their data changes now<br>

                    * Tweaked the connection reading code a lot. Hopefully this helps.<br>

                    * Made glowstone drop more loot<br>
                    * Made the recipe sizes for creating cloth blocks and glowstone blocks smaller (2x2 instead of 3x3)<br>
                    * Re-introduced unlimited FPS, renamed the option again<br>
                    * Removed Herobrine<br>
