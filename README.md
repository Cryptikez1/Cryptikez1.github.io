Hello, this is a current passion project that I am working on. This project that im working on is a remake of the old minecraft website(s) and minecraft itself.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH NOTCH/MOJANG NOR EAGLERCRAFT!!!**

For this project im using eaglercraft, and The old minecraft websites, What I do is i copy the old minecraft websites, Fix them up a bit then start publishing it into a
repository on github. And then I compile a build of eaglercraft (minecraft in your browser) and add it to the website, this makes a old minecraft website with a functioning
version. For instance check out my "Alpha 1.2.6" at "https://cryptikez1.github.io" I remade the website and used peytonplays/lax1dude's Eaglercraft a.1.2.6 version to make
the minecraft function on the website.

I will post a couple of screenshots down below later or now, If im not too lazy...

Reminder: I only make this for fun, I may add other versions **IF** I feel like it.
